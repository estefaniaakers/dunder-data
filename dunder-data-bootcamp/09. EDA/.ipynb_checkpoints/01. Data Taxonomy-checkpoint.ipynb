    "# 1. Data Taxonomy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be aware of the different types of data that you will encounter\n",
    "* Know the difference between a formal data type in a Pandas DataFrame or NumPy array vs the generic term used to classify that type of data\n",
    "* Pandas uses numbers or characters for all of its data types\n",
    "* Know the difference between a categorical and a continuous variable\n",
    "* Know the difference between an ordinal and nominal categorical variable\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types vs Data Taxonomy\n",
    "Thus far we have seen the formal Pandas data types that are shown when running the `dtypes` attribute from a DataFrame. These data types are the most fundamental property of each column in the DataFrame and tell us exactly what type each value is within the columns. The only caveat here is the 'object' data type which can hold any Python object, but typically contains strings. Let's take a look at all the formal Pandas data types again. We have yet to talk much about the **category** data type but will do so shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* boolean\n",
    "* integer\n",
    "* float\n",
    "* object\n",
    "* datetime\n",
    "* timedelta\n",
    "* period\n",
    "* category\n",
    "\n",
    "The formal Pandas data types do not give us insights into what kind of data each column represents. For instance, a column of integers can represent something as simple as whether a college is religiously affiliated with either 0 or 1. It can also represent something more varied such as an employees salary or even something more arbitrary like a zip code. Just knowing that a column's data type is an integer doesn't give us clues to how to further process it. It only informs us that every other value in the column is also an integer. And specifically with Pandas, no missing values would be present either.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the term **data taxonomy** makes its way into this discussion. When I use the term data taxonomy, I am referring to the general category that we could label each column of data regardless of its underlying Pandas data type. For instance, I could label a 0/1 integer column, such as the religiously affiliated college dataset column, as a \"binary categorical\". Binary meaning there are only two possible values, and categorical meaning that each observation is in precisely one discrete category. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many such distinctions and labels that can be created to form a data taxonomy. Surprisingly, there is no standard taxonomy that is common to all data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical Data Taxonomies\n",
    "To get a broader picture of the history of data taxonomy, consider reading the Wikipedia page on [Level of Measurement][1]. There have been different proposals over time, but nothing that has caught on universally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common and Simple Taxonomy\n",
    "Many machine learning tutorials will make use of a simple taxonomy to categorize each type of column.  Data is split into two types - **categorical** and **continuous**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical being defined as data that is limited to discrete categories such as zip code, state, or ranking of your knowledge of Python programming. Usually, there is a known number of discrete categories, but that isn't strictly necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous data, on the other hand, consists of a range of real-valued numbers. This data is not restricted to be a certain value. Height of a table, price of a television, square footage of a house can all be considered continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ordinal vs Nominal Categorical Variable\n",
    "Categorical variables can be further subdivided into **ordinal** and **nominal**. Ordinal variables have a natural ordering such as the ranking of your Python programming skills or your assessment of a restaurant (Bad, Average, Good). Nominal categorical variables have no natural ordering such as state names or zip codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorical variables can be numeric or strings\n",
    "Categorical variables can be either numeric (Python skill level) or strings (state names). It is often the case that numeric variables are continuous but this is certainly not always true. You must be aware of when numeric variables are actually categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous variables, on the other hand, are always going to be numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The simple and common taxonomy\n",
    "We can map this simple taxonomy with the following list.\n",
    "* Continuous\n",
    "* Categorical\n",
    "    * Ordinal\n",
    "    * Nominal\n",
    "\n",
    "## A slightly different look at the data taxonomy\n",
    "I like to first make a distinction between numeric, text, and date data. This is what your brain immediately recognizes when it sees data. Each column will be one of these three forms (assuming booleans are considered numeric). After initially recognizing the column as one of these three forms, we can then observe it as either continuous, ordinal or nominal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numeric\n",
    "    * Represents any kind of number\n",
    "    * Can be continuous, ordinal, or nominal\n",
    "    * Continuous variable may be binned to make categorical\n",
    "    * Boolean columns are categorical\n",
    "* Text\n",
    "    * Represents a sequence of characters (strings)\n",
    "    * Can only be ordinal or nominal\n",
    "    * If data has high cardinality, further processing might need to be done\n",
    "* Date\n",
    "    * Represents date, time, datetime, time period, or amount of time\n",
    "    * Each type can be continuous, ordinal, or nominal\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Numeric, text and date are flexible\n",
    "Notice that there is no one-to-one mapping from these terms to their generic data type. Only text data cannot be continuous, otherwise all data can be any interpreted as any of the generic data types based on the context of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of different types\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numeric\n",
    "    * Weight of a person - continuous\n",
    "    * Percent scored correct on a test - continuous\n",
    "    * Temperature - continuous\n",
    "    * Ages binned to 18-24, 25-39, 40-55, 55+ - ordinal\n",
    "    * Stages of cancer (1, 2, 3, 4) - ordinal\n",
    "    * Zip codes - nominal\n",
    "* Text\n",
    "    * State names - nominal\n",
    "    * Survey ratings - ordinal\n",
    "    * Movie review - needs more processing to be useful\n",
    "* Date\n",
    "    * Employee hire date - ordinal\n",
    "    * Day of week - nominal\n",
    "    * Stock market data - continuous\n",
    "    * Amount of time to finish a race - continuous\n",
