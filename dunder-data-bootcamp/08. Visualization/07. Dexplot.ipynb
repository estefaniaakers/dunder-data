    "# 7. Dexplot\n",
    "\n",
    "Dexplot is a package that I created to further simplify Seaborn. You may be thinking that Seaborn is simple enough, but there is quite a bit of replication and several things that can be improved. For instance, there are about 5 different functions that create scatterplots (`relplot`, `scatterplot`, `lmplot`, `regplot` and `jointplot`). There are only minor differences between these plots, so a single scatter plot function could suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few more things that could be improved in Seaborn:\n",
    "* There is no easy way to create relative frequency plots\n",
    "* No way to control the size of the figure and several other matplotlib properties without actually using matplotlib itself\n",
    "* No way to use a strings for functions when grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The goal of Dexplot is simplicity\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently only three functions available in Dexplot - `aggplot`, `jointplot`, and `heatmap`. The `aggplot` function is similar to `catplot` in Seaborn. I named it `aggplot` because it is used to aggregate data (which is what `catplot` does). Instead of `x` and `y`, `aggplot` uses `agg` and `groupby`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable being aggregated gets passed to `agg` and the variable doing the grouping gets passed to `groupby`. It is no different than calling a `groupby` method on a DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install with `pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to install by running the `pip install dexplot` or perhaps `pip3 install dexplot`."
