    "# 8. Boolean Indexing Single Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Boolean Indexing or Boolean Selection is the selection of a subset of a Series/DataFrame based on the **values** themselves and not the row/column labels or integer location\n",
    "+ Boolean means **`True`** or **`False`**\n",
    "+ Each row of the DataFrame will be kept or discarded based on the boolean value aligned with it\n",
    "+ Boolean selection has a two-step process\n",
    "    + First, create a **filter** - a sequence of True/False values the same length as the DataFrame/Series\n",
    "    + Second, pass this filter to one of the indexers **`[ ]`** or **`.loc`**\n",
    "+ Boolean selection does not work with **`.iloc`**\n",
    "+ The indexing operators are overloaded — change functionality depending on what is passed to them\n",
    "+ The filter is commonly created by comparing a column of data (a Series) against some scalar value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Boolean Indexing\n",
    "Boolean indexing, also referred to as **Boolean Selection**, is the process of selecting subsets of rows from DataFrames (or Series) based on the actual data values and NOT by their labels or integer locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples of Boolean Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some examples of actual questions (in plain English) that boolean indexing can help us answer from the bikes dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Find all male riders\n",
    "+ Find all rides with duration longer than 2 hours\n",
    "+ Find all rides that took place between March and June of 2015.\n",
    "+ Find all the rides with a duration longer than 2 hours by females with temperature higher than 90 degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **query** is used to refer to these sorts of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### All queries have a logical condition\n",
    "Each of the above queries have a strict logical condition that must be checked one row at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keep or discard an entire row of data\n",
    "If you were to manually answer the above queries, you would need to scan each row and determine whether the row as a whole meets the condition. If so, then it is kept, otherwise it is discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Each row will have a True or False value associated with it\n",
    "When you perform boolean indexing, each row of the DataFrame (or value of a Series) will have a True or False value associated with it depending on whether or not it meets the condition. True/False values are known as boolean. The documentation refers to the entire procedure as boolean indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are using the booleans to select data, it is sometimes referred to as **boolean selection**. We are using booleans to select subsets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beginning with a small DataFrame\n",
    "We will perform our first boolean indexing on a dataset of 5 rows. Let's assign the head of the bikes dataset to its own variable. The `bikes_head` DataFrame has five rows in it."
