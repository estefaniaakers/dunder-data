    "# 8. Boolean Indexing - DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Boolean Indexing or Boolean Selection is the selection of a subset of a Series/DataFrame based on the values themselves and not the row/column labels or integer location\n",
    "+ Boolean means **`True`** or **`False`**\n",
    "+ To do boolean selection, you first create a sequence of True/False values and pass it to a DataFrame/Series indexer. Each row of data is kept or discarded\n",
    "+ The indexing operators are overloaded — change functionality depending on what is passed to them\n",
    "+ Typically, you will first create a boolean Series with one of the 6 comparison operators\n",
    "+ You will pass this boolean series to one of the indexers to make your selection\n",
    "+ Use the **`isin`** method to test for multiple equalities in the same column\n",
    "+ You can create complex criteria with the and (**`&`**), or (**`|`**), and not (**`~`**) logical operators\n",
    "+ When you have multiple conditions in a single line, you must wrap each expression with a parentheses\n",
    "+ If you have complex criteria, think about assigning each set of criteria into its own variable (i.e. don't do everything in one line)\n",
    "+ If you are only selecting rows, then you will almost always use just the brackets\n",
    "* If you are simultaneously doing boolean selection on the rows and selecting column labels then you will use **`.loc`**\n",
    "+ You will almost never use .iloc to do boolean selection\n",
    "+ Boolean selection works the same for Series as it does for DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Boolean Indexing\n",
    "Boolean indexing, also referred to as **Boolean Selection**, is the process of selecting subsets of rows from DataFrames (or Series) based on the actual values and NOT by their labels or integer locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples of Boolean Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into Pandas, lets see some examples of actual questions (in plain English) that boolean indexing can help us answer from the bikes dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Find all male riders\n",
    "+ Find all rides with duration longer than 2 hours\n",
    "+ Find all rides that took place between March and June of 2015.\n",
    "+ Find all the rides that a duration longer than 2 hours by females with temperature higher than 90 degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **query** is used to refer to these sorts of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### All queries have criteria\n",
    "Each of the above queries have a strict logical criteria that must be checked one row at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keep or Discard entire row of data\n",
    "If you were to manually answer the above queries, you would need to scan each row and determine whether the row as a whole meets the criterion or not. If the row meets the criteria, then it is kept and if not, then it is discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Each row will have a True or False value associated with it\n",
    "When you perform boolean indexing, each row of the DataFrame (or value of a Series) will have a True or False value associated with it depending on whether or not it meets the criterion. True/False values are known as boolean. The documentation refers to the entire procedure as boolean indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are using the booleans to select data, it is sometimes referred to as boolean selection. We are using booleans to select subsets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beginning with a small DataFrame\n",
    "We will perform our first boolean indexing on a dataset of 5 rows. Let's assign the head of the bikes dataset to its own variable."
