    "## Only selected subsets of data\n",
    "Up to this point, we have only selected subsets of data. We have not changed the data or made any operations on the data. Our selections have happened in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Selection by label and integer location\n",
    "* Selection by actual values of the DataFrame (Boolean Selection)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these methods involve using Python's selection operator, brackets **`[]`**. Boolean selection formed Series of booleans with the comparison operators, **`<`**, **`>`**, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calling methods on a Series/DataFrame\n",
    "Selecting subsets of data does not usually require calling methods using dot notation. In this notebook we will call many methods that will perform actions on our DataFrame. We have actually already done some of this with **`head`**, **`tail`**, **`isna`**, and **`set_index`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more than 250 methods available to both DataFrames and Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use a small subset of methods\n",
    "It can be quite overwhelming to think about having to learn and memorize this staggering amount of functionality. The good news is that many of these methods are quite unnecessary and don't add any extra functionality. Furthermore, many methods are remnants from the early days of Pandas and have few/no use cases or have been **deprecated**. When a method is deprecated, then it both discouraged from being used and will likely be removed from the library in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimally Sufficient Pandas\n",
    "I suggest to use a subset of the Pandas library that allows you to do as many tasks as possible. You should strive to write Pandas as simple as possible to maximize both performance and readability. Since there is so much functionality, power users of Pandas can think of very creative and complex code to accomplish different tasks. This is NOT a positive thing and when working with a group of other data scientists can lead to confusion for those that are not familiar with the syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Knowing lots of tricks doesn't help\n",
