    "## Pandas Intro\n",
    "* Started by Wes McKinney at hedge fund AQR in 2008\n",
    "* Built directly on numpy\n",
    "* Two main data structures, Series - one dimension, DataFrame - two dimensions\n",
    "* Name from panel + data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Help\n",
    "* The documentation is excellent - http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/\n",

    "# Python\n",
    "* Everything in Python is an object except the syntatical structures like for, if and operators, etc...\n",
    "* Every object has a type\n",
    "* **`type`** function rerturns you objects type.\n",
    "* Always know the type of object you have\n",
    "* All objects have attributes (descriptions) and methods (actions) which unleash all of their abilities\n",
    "* Methods must be executed with `()`\n",
    "* Use **`dir`** to uncover all attributes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pandas\n",
    "* Excellent at tabular data analysis.\n",
    "* Relies heavily on NumPy to store data and do calculations.\n",
    "* DataFrame is primary data structure - two dimensional\n",
    "* Series is one column of data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Series\n",
    "**Anatomy**\n",
    "![](images/series_anatomy.png)\n",
    "* One dimensional object\n",
    "* Two components to a Series - the **index** and the **data (values)**\n",
    "* **`value_counts`**. Counts and orders all values. Returns a Series with old values in the index and their counts as the new values. Use with `normalize=True` to return percentage of counts.\n",
    "* All arithmetic operators work as expected on each value of Series. `s + 5` adds 5 to each element. This operation is vectorized - very fast with no for loops\n",
    "* Construct a Series by hand with `pd.Series` with a list, dict, or numpy array. If passed a dictionary, it puts the keys in the index.\n",
    "* Operators like `+, -, *, /, **`are **vectorized** and operate on each element of the Series at once. `s + 4` adds 4 to each value in the Series.\n",
    "* Summary statistics: `s.mean(), s.median(), s.sum(), s.max(), s.min()`\n",
    "* Accumulation methods `s.cumsum`, etc...\n",
    "* Get the values: `s.values` - returns a numpy array\n",
    "* Get the index: `s.index` - returns Index type. `s.index.values` returns a numpy array of the index\n",
    "* Get in the habit of using **`head, tail`** to shorten long output\n",
    "* Sort by the values or the index: `s.sort_vales()` or `s.sort_index()`. Use boolean parameter **`ascending=False`** to from high to low\n",
    "* Get the number of elements in Series: `s.size` or `len(s)`\n",
    "* Get the data type of the series with **`s.dtype`**\n",
    "* Get several summary statistics with **`s.describe`**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting subsets of Series \n",
    "\n",
    "* There are two main indexers - **`.loc`** for labels and **`.iloc`** for integer location\n",
    "* Both indexers can take either a **scalar**, a **list**, or **slice notation**\n",
    "* **`s.loc['label1']`** - scalar that selects a single item in Series\n",
    "* **`s.loc[['label1', 'label5']]`** - use a list to select disjoint items\n",
    "* **`s.loc['start':'stop':step]`** - use a slice to select from start to stop inclusive\n",
    "* **`s.iloc[integer1]`** - scalar that selects a single item in Series\n",
    "* **`s.iloc[[integer1, integer2]]`** - use a list to select disjoint items\n",
    "* **`s.iloc[start:stop:step]`** - use a slice to select from start to stop inclusive\n",
    "*  use `s.at[label]` and `s.iat[interger_location]` for some speed-up of single (scalar) value selection\n",
    "* **`.ix`** is deprecated. Do NOT use it.\n",
    "* **`s[label]`** works for both integer and label location. It is ambiguous. Avoid if possible.\n",
    "* **`automatic alignment of index`** - be careful when operating with two Series at the same time. They will join on the index first, creating a cartesian product and then complete the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boolean Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Boolean indexing works by passing in a Series, or other sequence of booleans to the indexing operator. Only values that are True remain in the Series after.\n",
    "* Must create a Series of booleans first. Sometimes save this to a variable **`criteria`**\n",
    "*  **`s[criteria]`**  does the boolean selection\n",
    "* Use `& | ~` to Create multiple and complex boolean conditions. Wrap each condition in parentheses\n",
    "* Criteria example: **`criteria = ((s > 5) | (s < -2)) & (s % 2 == 0)`**\n",
    "* Use **`s.isin([1,2,3])`** instead of **`(s == 1) | (s == 2) | (s == 3)`**\n",
    "* **`s.isnull()`** turns every value into a boolean whether its missing or not\n",
    "* Series are mutable. Be careful when doing **`s1 = s; s.iloc[2] = 10`**. This will mutate both Series. Use **`s1 = s.copy()`**\n",
    "* Its ok to use the indexing operator for boolean selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More Series methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`s.drop(index_label)`** deletes a Series element\n",
    "* **`s.idxmax()`** gets the index label of the maximum value\n",
    "* **`s.where(condition, other_value)`** make all values where condition is false some other value\n",
    "* **`s.mask(condition, other_value)`** makes all values where condition is true some other value: \n",
    "* **`s.pct_chage`** Find the percentage change from the previous value to current value\n",
    "* **`s.diff(lag)`** - Subtract the series from itself by some lag\n",
    "* The **`inplace`** argument appears in many methods. It is defaulted to False. Make it true to mutate the underlying object. It will return `None` if True. NOT best practice\n",
    "* **`s.unique()`** returns a numpy array of unique values\n",
    "\n",
    "## DataFrame\n",
    "**Anatomy**\n",
    "![](images/dataframe_anatomy.png)\n",
    "* 2 dimensional. rows and columns. \n",
    "* Three main components - **index**, **columns** and **data (values)**\n",
    "* The index labels the rows and the columns label the columns\n",
    "* Uses an Index object for both the rows and the columns\n",
    "* The row Index is simply called the index. The column index is called the columns.\n",
    "* Access Index with `df.index` and the columns with `df.columns`\n",
    "* Construct a DataFrame with a 2d numpy array, a dictionary of lists/Series, or reading in a file (csv,json)\n",
    "* Create new column from other columns: **`df[new_col] = df[col1] - df[col2].mean()`**\n",
    "* Insert a column somewhere in the middle: **`df.insert()`**\n",

    "\n",
    "### Selecting subsets of DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "* Indexing operator is different for DataFrames than Series. It selects a column or columns.\n",
    "* **`df[col1]`** selects a single column as a Series\n",
    "* **`df[[col1, col2, col3]]`** selects multiple columns. Notice the inner list\n",
    "*  **`df[[col]]`** selects a one column DataFrame\n",
    "* **`.iloc`** uses integer location and **`.loc`** uses index labels.\n",
    "* These indexers can make selections by both rows and columns\n",
    "* **`.iloc`** and **`.loc`** accept scalars, lists and slice notation. \n",
    "* They first select by rows - **`df.loc[label]`** selects a single row of data as a Series\n",
    "* **`df.loc[[label, label2]]`** selects multiple rows as a DataFrame\n",
    "* **`df.loc[start:stop:step]`** - slice notation selects multiple rows as a DataFrame\n",
    "* **`.iloc`** works the same way except with integers\n",
    "* Select rows and columns at the same time by using a comma after the row selection\n",
    "* **`df.loc[label1 : label2 : 3, [\"col1\", \"col2\"]]`** uses slice notation for the rows and a list for the columns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boolean Indexing for DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "* Boolean indexing works the same way as it does for Series except the criteria is made up of columns\n",
    "* Example Criteria: `criteria = ((df[col1] > 5) | (df[col2] < -2)) & (df[col3] % 2 == 0)`\n",
    "* **`df[criteria]`** selects all the columns for the rows that are true\n",
    "* Use **`df.loc[criteria, [col1, col2]]`** to do boolean selection on the rows and also select columns with a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More DataFrame methods\n",
    "* Most DataFrame methods have an `axis` parameter that controls whether the action will take place across the rows up down the columns.\n",
    "* `axis` equal to 0 or `index` will perform the action down the columns. `axis` equal to 1 or `columns` will perform the action across the rows. Default is axis=0\n",
    "* **`df.rename()`** renames an index label or a column name \n",
    "* **`df.drop()`** deletes rows or columns \n",
    "* Make use of the index! Place a column into the index: **`df.set_index('column name')`**\n",
    "* Make the index a column: **`df.reset_index()`**\n",
    "* Remove duplicate rows with `df.drop_duplicates()`. Use the **`subset`** parameter to find duplicates from a subset of columns\n",
    "* Fill missing values with `df.fillna(value)`. Pass another DataFrame to .fillna to map specific values to the missing ones.\n",
    "* **`df.select_dtypes`** to choose columns based on their data type\n",
    "* Style your DataFrame with **`df.style.`** Press tab to see style types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Split - Apply - Combine\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split - Splits your data into specific groups\n",
    "* Apply - Apply a function to each of your groups\n",
    "* Combine - Put the results of the apply function back together\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common split-apply-combine pattern has three components - **grouping columns**, **aggregating columns**, and **aggregating functions**. There are several types of syntax that can be used with the most common below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> df.groupby(['grouping columns')['aggregating columns'].agg(['aggregating functions'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have just a single aggregating function you may do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> df.groupby(['grouping columns'])['aggregating columns'].aggregating_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **grouping columns** - Each unique combination forms a group\n",
    "* **aggregating columns** - Values of these columns are going to be aggregated into a single number\n",
    "* **aggregating functions** - Determines how the aggregation will happen - **`sum, mean, median`**, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "* `groupby` method does split-apply-combine in pandas. Can be done with a Series grouping the index but mainly done on DataFrames. Examples below will concentrate on DataFrames\n",
    "* Create groupby object: `grouped = df.groupby(['grouping columns'])`\n",
    "* Dictionary of groups: `grouped.groups`\n",
    "* Number of groups: `grouped.ngroups`\n",
    "* Get a specific group: `grouped.get_group('group name')`\n",
    "* Iterate through groups: `for name, group in grouped: print(name); print(group);`\n",
    "* When the world 'aggregation' is used in the groupby context, it means turning all the values of one group into one specific value.\n",
    "* Aggregating groups: `df.groupby([grouping columns])[aggregating columns].aggregating_function()`\n",
    "* Aggregating function from line above can be `min, max, sum, mean, count, size, std` and more.\n",
    "* Use many functions to aggregate: `df.groupby([grouping columns])[aggregating columns].agg([list of aggregating functions])`\n",
    "* You can put anonymous functions and custom functions in your list of aggregating functions\n",
    "* To prevent the grouping columns going into the index use parameter `as_index=False` in the groupby method.\n",
    "* For non-aggregating function use `.apply` instead of `.agg` and pass in your custom function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "* For any numerical Series: `s.plot()` will produce a line plot by default with index as x-axis and values as y-axis.\n",
    "* Use parameter `kind=` to change plot type to `hist, bar, barh, kde, pie, box, density, area`\n",
    "* `linestyle` (ls) - Pass a string of one of the following ['--', '-.', '-', ':']\n",
    "* `color` (c) - Can take a string of a named color, a string of the hexadecimal characters or a rgb tuple with each number between 0 and 1. [Check out this really good stackoverflow post to see the colors](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22408237/named-colors-in-matplotlib)\n",
    "* `linewidth` (lw) - controls thickness of line. Default is 1\n",
    "* `alpha` - controls opacity with a number between 0 and 1\n",
    "* `figsize` - a tuple used to control the size of the plot. (width, height) \n",
    "* `legend` - boolean to control legend\n",
    "* Change plotting template with `plt.style.use('ggplot')`. See all templates with `plt.style.available`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "* Original purpose of Pandas\n",
    "* Date is month, day, year\n",
    "* Time is Hour, minute, second, micro/nano\n",
    "* Datetime is both date and time\n",
    "* Python's datetime standard library allows creation of date, time and datetime objects with functions with the same name\n",
    "* timedelta function allows addition of time to datetime objcets\n",
    "* pandas uses the Timestamp object which is numpy's datetime64 object. It has nanosecond precision as opposed to datetime's microsecond\n",
    "* create a date range with `pd.date_range`\n",
    "* Become familiar with the date offsets\n",
    "* Putting Timestamp's in the index is very useful\n",
    "* Slice a timestamp with `s['2014-01-01:2014-02-28']`\n",
    "* Shift an index with `s.shift(5, freq='D')` Again use date offsets as frequency\n",
    "* Use `s.asfreq('W')` to sample your time series at a particular interval\n",
    "* Use anchored offsets to further choose how to choose your interval. `s.asfreq('W-MON')`\n",
    "* Use resample to aggregate a time series over an interval. `s.resmaple('5D').sum()`\n",
    "* To use many different aggregation functions use .agg: `s.resample('3W').agg(['min', 'max', 'sum'])`\n",
    "* Can do rolling aggregations: `s.rolling(10).mean()` This does a rolling average of last 10 time periods\n",
    "* These functions work with both Series and DataFrames as long as the Timestamp is in the index"
