    "# 6. DataFrame Descriptive Statistic Methods\n",
    "DataFrames have identical [descriptive statistical methods][1] as Series. Again, we distinguish between methods that aggregate and those that do not. A method that performs an aggregation returns a **single** number to represent the description. Examples of methods that aggregate are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sum`\n",
    "* `min`\n",
    "* `max`\n",
    "* `mean`\n",
    "* `median`\n",
    "* `std` - standard deviation\n",
    "* `var` - variance\n",
    "* `count` - returns number of non-na values\n",
    "* `describe` - returns most of the above aggregations in one Series\n",
    "* `quantile` - returns given percentile of distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Any other method that does not return a single value is not an aggregation. Some examples of these methods are:\n",
    "* `abs` - takes absolute value\n",
    "* `round` - round to the nearest given decimal\n",
    "* `cummin` - cumulative minimum\n",
    "* `cummax` - cumulative maximum\n",
    "* `cumsum` - cumulative sum\n",
    "* `rank` - rank values in a variety of different ways\n",
    "* `diff` - difference between one element and another\n",
    "* `pct_change` - percent change from one element to another\n",
