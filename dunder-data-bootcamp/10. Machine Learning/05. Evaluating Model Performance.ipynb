    "# 5. Evaluating Model Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "* Learn how to estimate a model's performance on unseen data\n",
    "* Understand why evaluating on the training set is wrong\n",
    "* Know what generalization performance is\n",
    "* Learn how to create a training/testing split\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "* [Four-part series][1] on model evaluation by Sebastian Raschka\n",
    "* Scikit-Learn user guide on [cross validation][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the previous notebooks, we have been evaluating our model performance by calling each estimator's `score` method which returned the accuracy. All of this scoring we've done so far is wrong. Evaluating our model's performance on the same data that we trained them on, will not give us a true measure of how likely it is to perform in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is akin to taking a test in school where the professor hands you the questions and answers beforehand. Our score gives us very little information about how well we would do on questions we've never encountered before.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal: Estimate Accuracy on Future Unseen Data\n",
    "One of the major goals of machine learning is to have a good idea of how well the model will perform on future unseen data. When the model is released into the wild, how will it perform? This is sometimes referred to as **generalization error** (or [generalization error][3]). In other words, it is a measurement of how well the model generalizes to data that it has not seen before. There are several ideas that have been developed to calculate this generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# First idea, create a \"holdout\" test set that is not used during training\n",
    "A simple idea is to partition the original dataset into two distinct datasets, one to be used during training, and another to be withheld for evaluating performance. This holdout dataset is also referred to as the **test** dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use the `train_test_split` helper function\n",
    "The helper function `train_test_split` may be used to split the data into training and test sets. It accepts both the input, `X`, and labels, `y`, and splits each one into train and test sets returning four total arrays. Typical splits place more data in the training than the test set. By default, a 75/25 split is used, but we can use the `test_size` parameter to change this. Below, we choose two columns to be in our input dataset and make a 70/30 split.\n",
