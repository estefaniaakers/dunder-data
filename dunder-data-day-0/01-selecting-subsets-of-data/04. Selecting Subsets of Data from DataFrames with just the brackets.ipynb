    "# Pandas dual references: by label and by integer location\n",
    "As previously mentioned, the index of each DataFrame provides a label to reference each individual row. Similarly the columns provide a label to reference each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "What hasn't been mentioned, is that each row and column may be referenced by an integer as well. I call this **integer location**. The integer location begins at 0 and ends at n-1 for each row and column. Take a look above at our sample DataFrame one more time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rows with labels **`Aaron`** and **`Dean`** can also be referenced by their respective integer locations 2 and 4. Similarly, the columns **`color`**, **`age`**, and **`height`** can be referenced by their integer locations 1, 3, and 4.\n",

    "# What's the difference between indexing and selecting subsets of data?\n",
    "The documentation uses the term **indexing** frequently. This term is essentially just a one-word phrase to say **subset selection**.

Indexing is also the term used in the official Python documentation (for selecting subsets of lists or strings for example).\n",
