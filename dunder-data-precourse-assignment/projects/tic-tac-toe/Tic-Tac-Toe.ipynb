    "# Create a Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n",
    "This notebook will explain how to build a tic-tac-toe game. It will consist of several functions that each complete a specific task. You will write your code for each function in the `tic_tac_toe.py` file in this directory. Open up that file in an editor. I suggest installing VS Code or Sublime, but you can choose any editor that you like. \n",

    "## The functions\n",
    "Within `tic_tac_toe.py` you will see many functions. Each one will complete a specific task. We will build each function one at a time. Notice that each function has the word `pass` in its body. This is a keyword that means to do no thing. You will delete it and write the function.\n",

    "## Create the board\n",
    "The board will be a 3-item list where each element holds a 3-item list of strings. Each string will be a single space. Return this list of lists from the function. Edit the `tic_tac_toe.py` function now and update the `create_empty_board` function.\n",

    "In order to have all your saved code changed, you will need to run the following two magic commands. This will \"reload\" the function to its most recently saved state. Without doing this, you would have to restart the notebook every time you saved new code."

What often happens is that you will create one large function and the refactor this into smaller functions (or classes with methods) later. This is a perfectly legitimate way of programming so don't be alarmed if you aren't sure what functions to create first."
